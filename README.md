### Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - Create a GitHub repository, Then clone the Code Institute Template into it.
  - In the Code Institute page select "Go to IDE" (CodeAnywhere) and creat a new workspace.
  - Then copy the repository into the workspace.
  - Now go to to the repository page and navigate to the Settings tab.
  - From the source section drop-down menu, I selected the Master Branch.
  - Once the master branch was selected, the page automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
